# Missile-GNC

The repository contains simulink model for implementation of a GNC algorithms for Missile Guidance. The longitudnal dynamics of the missile were derived from a paper published by Raytheon, linked in the repository as well. The GNC model uses observer for navigation, standard trignometry for guidance, and PID control loop for controls.
