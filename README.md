# Missile-GNC

The repository contains simulink model for implementation of a GNC algorithms for Missile Guidance. The longitudnal dynamics of the missile were derived from a paper published by Raytheon, linked in the repository as well. The GNC model uses observer for navigation, standard trignometry for guidance, and PID control loop for controls. The controllers for both inner (observer) and outer (PID) loop are calculated using the code in the .py file. Control module is used for the same.
